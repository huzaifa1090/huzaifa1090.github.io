Hi, I am Muhammad Huzaifa, a Computer Vision Master research student, affilated with [IVAL](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/) at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) and [Dr. Fahad Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home?pli=1&authuser=1). My research focus is on adapting foundational multi-modal models for vision tasks including image recognition, detection and video action recognition. The goal is to steer these foundational models for downstream tasks with limited data (few-/zero-shot setup) while maintaining their inherent pre-trained generalization towards novel tasks.
