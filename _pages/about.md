Hi, I am Muhammad Huzaifa, a Machine Learning Master research student, affilated with [IVAL](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/) at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) and [Dr. Fahad Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home?pli=1&authuser=1). My research focuses on investigating robust visual perception through techniques such as adversarial machine learning and representation learning. Additionally, I explore the adaptation of multi-modal models for vision tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and image captioning, especially in scenarios with limited data, including few-/zero-shot learning setups.
